The report must be submitted as a single PDF file. The code must be submitted as a single archive file (e.g. zip or 7z) that is self-contained and can be used to reproduce the results in the report. \n",

You have to demonstrate to the reader that you understand the methods that you have studied and can critically analyze the results of applying the methods.

Every T1 slice comes in two versions: original and transformed with some random transformation that can be identified with the `_d` suffix in the filename. This simulates a registration problem where you have to register two image acquisitions of the same patient (note however that some of the transformations that were used to simulate the second set of images are not realistic for brain imaging, e.g. brain scans typically do not encounter shearing between consecutive acquisitions).\n",

After the transformation is calculated using different point pairs, otherwise the error would be low if not zero, because around these points you will perform the transformation. To measure the error you take the different point pairs that you identified before the transformation and calculate the difference, an absolute value of this should be taken. When you take more points for the registration in general the registration error should be lower. When you take less points the registration the registration error will be higher, since the transformation will only fit perfectly for only a few points but is not well generalized for other points such as the point pairs you use for the registration error."
